In the interest of creating a positive experience for people who use or
contribute to this project.

## Our Standards

* Assessing ideas and views based on their merit
* Providing and accepting constructive criticism

Examples of behavior that create a negative experience:

* Publishing others' private information without explicit written permission
* Violent threats or anything else not covered by the first amendment

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor who fail to abide by these standards.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project manager 
at johnpatek2@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will 
result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. 
The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the 
reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may 
be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
